These reduced-nicotine cigarettes are the first and only combustible tobacco products to receive Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reflecting their potential to significantly lower addiction potential and harm associated with smoking.

22nd Century Group holds a substantial patent portfolio covering methods for producing low-nicotine tobacco, genetically modified plants, and related processing technologies. This intellectual property provides a competitive edge in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk tobacco products.

Beyond tobacco, the company has explored applications in hemp and cannabis, including genetically modified plants with tailored cannabinoid profiles and agronomic traits. However, they have divested their hemp subsidiary, focusing primarily on their core tobacco harm reduction efforts.

In summary, 22nd Century Group leverages advanced plant biotechnology to create proprietary, reduced-nicotine tobacco products and potentially other plant-based applications, aiming to reduce the health risks associated with tobacco use through innovative science and regulatory approval.
